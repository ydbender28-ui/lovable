BUSINESS TYPE SECTION PLANS (follow the order closely):
- Spa/Salon/Beauty: Navbar→Hero→StickyBar→ServiceCards→SocialProof→BeforeAfter→Team→Reviews→Booking→MapSection→Footer
- Restaurant/Food: Navbar→Banner→Hero→MenuGrid→Gallery→SocialProof→Reviews→HoursTable→MapSection→Footer
- Fitness/Gym: Navbar→Hero→SocialProof→ServiceCards→StepProcess→Team→PricingTable→Reviews→Contact→Footer
- Medical/Dental: Navbar→Hero→ServiceCards→TrustBadges→Team→BeforeAfter→Reviews→Booking→MapSection→Footer
- Law/Professional: Navbar→Hero→Stats→ServiceCards→Team→Timeline→Reviews→Contact→Footer
- Retail/Ecommerce: Navbar→Banner→Hero→ShopGrid→Features→Reviews→Newsletter→Footer
- SaaS/Tech: Navbar→Hero→LogoCloud→Features→Comparison→PricingTable→FAQ→CTA→Footer
- Contractor/Trades: Navbar→Hero→ServiceCards→Gallery→StepProcess→Reviews→Contact→MapSection→Footer
- Hotel/Real Estate: Navbar→Hero→Gallery→Features→PricingTable→Reviews→MapSection→Contact→Footer
- Admin/Dashboard/CRM/Internal Tool: DashboardShell→DashboardStats→RevenueChart→DataTable→ActivityFeed→(OrdersTable or UserManagement or KanbanBoard based on context)→AnalyticsPanel

VARIETY RULES:
- For every build, include at least one "surprise" section not in the default plan for that type. Choose from: VideoSection, Countdown, Awards, SocialProof, AppDownload, QuoteBlock. Pick whichever fits the business best.
- Never use the exact same section list twice — vary order of non-critical middle sections slightly.
- ALWAYS place Contact or MapSection BEFORE Footer (never after).
- StickyBar must appear immediately AFTER Navbar (before Hero) for time-sensitive businesses: restaurants, salons, spas, event venues.
- Banner goes ABOVE Hero only when there is a promotion, sale, or urgent announcement.
- MenuGrid = food menus. ShopGrid = product stores. Never use both.

FEATURE SPECIFICITY RULES:
- Return 3-5 features that are concrete and specific to THIS business, not generic.
- BAD: ["booking form", "team section", "reviews"]
- GOOD: ["booking form with date/time/service picker and confirmation email", "team cards with headshots, credentials, and specialties", "Google star rating display with 5+ real-sounding reviews", "before/after photo slider showing treatment results"]

Return JSON only:
{
  "sections": ["Navbar", "Hero", "...in order...", "Footer"],
  "features": ["3-5 specific content/interactive features tailored to this business"]
}`,
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: `Build request: ${prompt}` }],
    }),
